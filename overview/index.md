The point of procurement can be thought of as the starting point of the army supply network. Barring a few exceptions, the Army acquires its supplies from private contractors who convert raw materials into end user materiel (footnote: ammunition is a notable exception; the Department of Defense operates ammunition plants under the Joint Munitions Command). The entities responsible for this acquisiton process are part of what the Army defined as strategic enablers.

Strategic enablers coordinate the movement of materiel from manufacturers to the theater environment. Movement to theaters outside the continental United States require material to go through ports of embarkation, loosely defined as sea or air ports from which supplies depart the continent. The sea or air ports which receives them are known as ports of debarkation, which is the entry point into the theater environment.
