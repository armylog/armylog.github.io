The point of procurement can be thought of as the starting point of the Army supply network. Barring a few exceptions, the Army acquires its supplies from private contractors who convert raw materials into end user materiel.[^1] The entities responsible for this acquisiton process are part of a group of entities referred to as strategic enablers.

Besides acquisition, strategic enablers conduct coordination of movement of materiel from manufacturers to the theater environment. Distribution to theaters outside the continental United States passes through ports of embarkation, or ports (naval or aerial) from which supplies depart the continent. The ports which receive them (sea or air) are known as ports of debarkation, which act as the supply entry point into a theater. The space between point of procurement and the port of debarkation is thought of as the strategic logistics domain (or the strategic support area).

Strategic enablers typically transfer responsibility of materiel to the the theater sustainment command (TSC) at ports of debarkation, marking the transition from the strategic to the operational logistics domain. The TSC subsequently distributes materiel throughout the area of responsibility (AOR) of its overseeing Army service component command (ASCC)[^2], with the aim of making materiel available to tactical units at the point of need.

The TSC may delegate theater sustainment planning for part of its AOR to an expeditionary sustainment command (ESC). This ESC provides additional command and control (C2) of operational support units who more precisely forecast and meet the needs of the tactical units within a particular area in the theater. Tactical units at or below the division level (such as the division sustainment brigade) coordinate with the TSC (or ESC, if one is attached to it) to obtain supplies at the point of need.

Support activities at the TSC/ESC level is characterized as operational, whereas activities at the division level and below are considered tactical. Tactical sustainment activities occur at the division level and below. The point of employment of distirbuted material marks the end of the Army supply distribution chain.
