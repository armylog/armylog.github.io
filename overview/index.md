The point of procurement can be thought of as the starting point of the Army supply network. Barring a few exceptions, the Army acquires its supplies from private contractors who convert raw materials into end user materiel[^1]. The entities responsible for this acquisiton process are part of what is often referred to as strategic enablers.

In addition to acquisition, strategic enablers conduct coordination of movement of materiel from manufacturers to the theater environment. Distribution to theaters outside the continental United States require material to go through ports of embarkation, defined as sea or air ports from which supplies depart the continent. The sea or air ports which receives them are known as ports of debarkation, which is thought of the supply entry point into a theater. The space between point of procurement from the industrial base and the port of debarkation is generally thought of as the strategic logistics domains (or the strategic support area).

The theater sustainment command (TSC) receives the materiel from strategic enablers most typically at the ports of debarkation. This transfer of responsibility marks the logistics domain transition from the strategic to the operational (the TSC being thought of to belong the "operational" level of war). The TSC subsequently distributes the transferred materiel throughout its area of responsibility (AOR), which corresponds to the area of responsibility of the Army service component command (ASCC) it belongs to[^2].
