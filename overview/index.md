The point of procurement can be thought of as the starting point of the Army supply network. Barring a few exceptions, the Army acquires its supplies from private contractors who convert raw materials into end user materiel.[^1] The entities responsible for this acquisiton process are part of what is often referred to as strategic enablers.

Besides acquisition, strategic enablers conduct coordination of movement of materiel from manufacturers to the theater environment. Distribution to theaters outside the continental United States passes through ports of embarkation, which are sea or air ports from which supplies depart the continent. The ports which receive them (naval or aerial) are known as ports of debarkation, which act as the supply entry point into a theater. The space between point of procurement and the port of debarkation is generally thought of as the strategic logistics domain (or the strategic support area).

Strategic enablers typically transfer responsibility of materiel to the the theater sustainment command (TSC) at ports of debarkation, and this transfer marks the logistics domain transition from the strategic to the operational. The TSC subsequently distributes the transferred materiel throughout its area of responsibility (AOR), which corresponds to the AOR of its overseeing Army service component command (ASCC).[^2] In conducting its theater sustainment planning, the TSC aims to make materiel available to tactical units at the point of need.

The TSC may delegate theater sustainment planning for part of its AOR to an expeditionary sustainment command (ESC). The ESC provides the TSC with additional command and control (C2) of operational support units who more precisely forecast the needs of the tactical units within its assigned AOR.
