An Expeditionary Sustainment Command (ESC) is a sustainment unit at the operational level that may be attached to a TSC or theater Army, or assigned to a corps. An ESC attached to a TSC executes the sustainment function of the TSC through command and control of all units assigned and attached by issuing OPORDs aligned with the TSC OPORD. ESCs normally deploy to execute command and control for multiple sustainment brigades within a portion of a TSC's AOR, with the intent of providing regional focus to increase the effectiveness of support operations in that area, allowing the TSC to focus on sustainment of the theater at large.

An ESC typically includes one or more sustainment brigade, a transportation brigade (expeditionary), and a movement control battalion. Through its subordinate units the ESC supports the TSC by executing theater opening/closing, sustainment, and distribution.
