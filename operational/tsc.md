## Theater Sustainment Command (TSC)

The TSC is the highest sustainment command in the operational level of warfare, responsible for planning and executing sustainment in a theater, or the area of responsibility (AOR) of a theater army. More specifically, it is a sustainment command assigned to an Army Service Component Command underneath a geographic combatant command with four operational responsibility areas:

* Theater Opening
* Theater Distribution (moving materiel and personnel)
* Sustainment (providing supply and services for units in the AOR to execute their missions)
* Theater Closing

The TSC is configurable and can be attached with varying logistical elements assembled to meet the specific needs of a theater. The sustainment function of the TSC is typically executed by an attached ESC, or less commonly, a sustainment brigade. The Special Troops Battalion (STB) and its Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) are the only units organic/assigned to the TSC, the rest being attached.

The TSC's responsibilities include:

* Coordinate with higher commands (either theater Army or geographic combatant command) to understand the theater mission requirements and communicate sustainment requirements and shortfalls.
* Coordinate directly with strategic enablers such as DLA and AMC to obtain and distribute goods and services (when directed by the theater Commander)
* Issues OPORDs to subordinate units which details tasks and outlines command and support relationships based on OPORD issued by theater Army.
* Execute command and control over asigned and attached units.
