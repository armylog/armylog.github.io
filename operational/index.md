# Operational Sustainment Units

Operational units act as a bridge between strategic enablers and tactical units. They coordinate with strategic entities in acquiring and distributing materiel and services employed by tactical units in a theater. Whereas strategic units coordinate movements of supply and personnel between theaters (intertheater), operational support units plan and execute support operations within a theater (intratheater). A theater can be roughly defined as the area of responsibility (AOR) of a theater army, which is the army service component command (ASCC) under a geographic combatant command. 

For example, the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) is the geographic combatant command whose AOR includes the middle east, central asia, and a portion of south asia. Subordinate to CENTCOM is the United States Army Central (ARCENT) which is the combatant command's Army service component command. ARCENT plans and executes its support activities in its AOR through the 1st Theater Sustainment Command (TSC), an operational level sustainment unit.

The TSC is the highest sustainment command at the operational sustainment level. All sustainment commands below the TSC and above the division level are generally thought of as operational sustainment area. Sustainment units at the operational level plan and execute support operations for tactical units at the division level and below by coordinating with strategic enablers in acquiring and distributing materiel and services.
