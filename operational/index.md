## Operational Units

Operational units act as a bridge between strategic enablers and tactical units. Whereas strategic units coordinate movements of supply and personnel between theaters (intertheater), operational support units plan and execute support operations within a theater (intratheater). A theater can be roughly defined as the area of responsibility (AOR) of a theater army, which is the army service component command (ASCC) under a geographic combatant command. 

For example, the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) is the geographic combatant command whose AOR includes the middle east, central asia, and a portion of south asia. Subordinate to CENTCOM is the United States Army Central (ARCENT) which is the combatant command's Army service component command. ARCENT plans and executes its support activities in its AOR through the 1st Theater Sustainment Command (TSC), and operational level sustainment unit.
