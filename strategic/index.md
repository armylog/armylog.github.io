# Strategic Entities

Strategic enablers serve as the Army's interface to the industrial base. Generally speaking, acquisitions for supplies used in common by all the services (such as food and fuel) are performed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and those specific to the Army (such as tank parts) are executed by the Army Materiel Command (AMC).[^1]

The U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) is a combatant command charged with the global distirbution of materiel and personnel. It is composed of the Air Force's Air Mobility Command, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, and the Army's Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC). The SDDC is a subordinate command to both TRANSCOM and AMC.

The Theater Sustainment Command (TSC) is an operational-level sustainment unit that coordinates with DLA, AMC, and TRANSCOM to obtain and distribute materiel throughout its AOR.

[^1]: Though acquisitions are conducted outside DLA and AMC, the majority of the Army's purchasing activities are conducted within the two agencies.
