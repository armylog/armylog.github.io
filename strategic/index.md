# Strategic Entities

Strategic enablers serve as the Army's interface to the industrial base. Generally speaking, acquisitions for supplies used in common by all the services (such as food and fuel) are performed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and those specific to the Army are executed by the Army Materiel Command (AMC).[^1]

[^1]: Though acquisitions are conducted outside DLA and AMC, the majority of the Army's purchasing activities are conducted within the two agencies.
