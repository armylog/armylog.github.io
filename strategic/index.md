# Strategic Entities

Strategic enablers serve as the Army's interface to the industrial base. Generally speaking, acquisitions for supplies used in common by all the services (such as food and fuel) are performed by the **Defense Logistics Agency** (DLA) and those specific to the Army (such as tank parts) are executed by the **Army Materiel Command** (AMC).[^1]

The **U.S. Transportation Command** (USTRANSCOM) is a combatant command charged with the global distirbution of materiel and personnel. It is composed of the Air Force's Air Mobility Command, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, and the Army's **Surface Deployment and Distribution Command** (SDDC). The SDDC is a subordinate command to both TRANSCOM and AMC.

DLA, AMC, and USTRANSCOM coordinates with a **Theater Sustainment Command** (TSC), an operational-level sustainment unit who obtain and distribute materiel to tactical units throughout its AOR.
