DLA integrates materiel management support of DLA common commodities such as subsistence,
clothing and other general supplies, packaged and bulk petroleum, and medical materiel. In addition, DLA
establishes fuel and water contracts with local venders in the absence of pre-established agreements with
nations in the theater. The DLA provides the Services, other federal agencies, and combined and allied forces
with the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition, and technical services. DLA provides most of the military’s
consumable, expendable, and repairable items and is the DOD EA for subsistence, bulk petroleum,
construction/barrier material, and medical materiel. In addition, DLA manages the reutilization of military
equipment, provides catalogs and other logistics information products, and offers document automation and
production services. In addition to the DLA organizations listed above, DLA Distribution provides wholesale
and retail-level storage and distribution to the CCMD in theater when requested by the CCDR.

DLA supports each CCMD with a DLA regional commander. This commander is the focal point for
coordinating all DLA activities throughout the theater and can provide flexible support on demand. Once the
Services identify the capabilities required, the requirement goes through the JTF commander, the CCDR and
to the joint staff for approval. Following approval, DLA organizes its capabilities to meet requirements. The
DLA regional commander will establish a Defense Logistics Agency contingency support team (DCST) to
provide direct support to the AO.

Defense Logistics Agency-Troop Support
1-115. DLA-Troop Support is a major subordinate command of DLA that manages the supply chain for
food, textiles, construction material, industrial hardware, and medical supplies and equipment, including
pharmaceuticals.

Defense Logistics Agency-Land and Maritime
1-113. DLA-Land and Maritime is a major subordinate command of DLA and is the land and maritime
supply chain manager. It is one of the largest suppliers of weapon systems spare parts in support of landbased
and maritime weapon systems. The command supports the Navy (surface and subsurface), Army, and
Marine Corps to fulfill requirements for assigned stock classes across the DOD and logistical services directly
to Navy shipyards and Army and Marine Corps industrial sites.
1-114. DLA-Land and Maritime also provides personnel support forward and is located with the Army,
Navy, and the Marine Corps throughout CONUS and outside the continental United States (OCONUS),
extending its footprint to ensure end-to-end supply chain management.

Defense Logistics Agency-Aviation
1-110. DLA-Aviation is a major subordinate command of DLA. It is the aviation supply chain manager for
much of the DOD, providing aviation weapons systems and environmental logistics support to the defense
aviation community and other governmental customers.
1-111. DLA-Aviation supports a vast number of joint aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, repair
parts, flight safety equipment, maps, environmental products, industrial plant equipment, and other weapons
systems. DLA-Aviation is also the U.S. military’s integrated material manager for over a million national
stock number items and industrial, retail supply, and depot-level repairable acquisitions.
1-112. DLA-Aviation supports the warfighter through weapons systems management and industrial, retail
supply, and strategic acquisition support operations. It plays a pivotal role in supporting Services with
targeted solutions and full-spectrum logistics support. This command also operates the federal government’s
only industrial plant equipment facility in the United States.

Defense Logistics Agency-Energy
1-109. The role of DLA-Energy is to provide contract support for the bulk petroleum supply chain, to
include worldwide acquisition of fuel-related services. In coordination with the theater petroleum center and
the TSC’s distribution management center (DMC) fuel and water branch, DLA-Energy helps the theater
Army sustainment staff determine and validate requirements against the theater Army commander’s priorities
for Army forces in the AOR. DLA-Energy provides contract support to meet worldwide military bulk fuel
needs by drafting, negotiating, concluding, and amending international fuel agreements with foreign
governments supporting worldwide DOD operations. Once requirements are complete (to include contracting
support), DLA-Energy then coordinates with the petroleum liaison teams, the Army Petroleum Center, the
theater Army, and the TSC staff for planning and specialized technical expertise as well as monitoring and
managing theater stocks.

Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services
1-107. DLA Disposition Services disposes of excess property received from the military services. The
excess property is first offered for reutilization within the DOD, transferred to other federal agencies, or
donated to state and local governments and other qualified organizations. DLA Disposition Services provide
the maximum amount of property disposition services and technical assistance as is practical within the AOR.
This can include management services for hazardous waste management and disposal, technical assistance
regarding demilitarization and trade security control requirements, and advice on disposal requirements. It
does not include the provision of disposition instructions for property or the proper supply condition code for
property as those functions are a Service responsibility.
1-108. Reutilization is the redistribution of excess items within the DOD and can be a significant part of
intratheater excess redistribution. Transfers to other federal agencies and donations to authorized recipients
are subject to the rules of the Department of State and will vary from country to country and operation to
operation. DLA Disposition Services also oversees the disposal of all hazardous material or hazardous waste.
To the extent possible, the centralized disposal activity shall physically accept and process all property for
which it has responsibility. DLA Disposition Services also supports disaster relief at home and humanitarian
assistance and foreign military sales programs. For further specific information, see DODM 4160.21.

Defense Logistics Agency Contingency Support Team Program
1-105. The DLA regional commanders provide liaison officers (LNOs) and functional experts under the
command of a DCST commander. These teams are rapidly deployed to provide support to a CCDR, JTF,
Service components, or subordinate unified commands during regional conflicts, contingency operations,
mobilization, emergencies, flexible deterrent options, exercises, or other situations. DCSTs are comprised of
active, reserve, and civilian personnel. While deployed, the DCST is under OPCON of the theater
commander, who may further delegate this duty as required.

1-106. The DCST provides logistical support to conflicts, natural disasters, emergencies, mobilizations, and
other contingency operations around the world. The DCSTs are responsible to the CCDR. The DCST works
directly with the sustainment command and integrates materiel management support of DLA common
commodities such as subsistence, protective clothing, general supplies, and bulk petroleum. It also provides
disposal support as appropriate, including the disposal of hazardous wastes. However, DCSTs require force
protection, life support, use of common-user land transport assets and may need terrain prepared for their
operations. For more details concerning support available to a specific operation, contact the DLA Customer
Interactions Center.
