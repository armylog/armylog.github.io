SDDC is the ASCC of USTRANSCOM and a subordinate command of AMC (SDDC reports to both AMC and TRANSCOM), and it serves as an interface between DOD shippers and the commercial transportation carrier industry. Though the military sealift command belongs to the Navy, SDDC is the single port manager for all seaports of embarkation and debarkation. SDDC supports the flow of deploying units, equipment, and sustainment into seaports of debarkation (SPODs).

Military Sealift Command (MSC)
