USTRANSCOM functions as the strategic enabler responsible for the movement of goods and personnel. It coordinates with DLA and AMC in executing delivery and it is composed of three component commands: 

the Army’s Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC)
the Navy’s Military Sealift Command (MSC), 
the Air Force’s Air Mobility Command (AMC)



Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command
1-90. SDDC is the ASCC of USTRANSCOM and a major subordinate command of USAMC. As a
component of USTRANSCOM, SDDC provides worldwide common-use ocean terminal services and traffic
management services to deploy, employ, sustain, and redeploy U.S. forces on a global basis. SDDC is the
defense transportation system’s interface between DOD shippers and the commercial transportation carrier
industry. SDDC’s assets provide coordination of force movement, status of worldwide infrastructure, and
seaport operations. The unique suite of traffic management capabilities includes freight and traffic
management, integrated transportation systems and intermodal contracts and agreements, and worldwide port
management.
1-91. SDDC is the single port manager for all common-user seaports of embarkation and debarkation. SDDC
supports the flow of deploying units, equipment, and sustainment into seaports of debarkation (SPODs).
SDDC supports all aspects of theater port operations and provides asset visibility information in accordance
with the CCDR’s priorities. See FM 4-0 and FM 4-01 for further information on SDDC.

Military Sealift Command
1-92. MSC is the Naval Service component command for USTRANSCOM. MSC provides worldwide
transportation of fuel, equipment, supplies, and ammunition during peace and war using government-owned
and chartered U.S. flagged ships. During contingencies, MSC uses its government-owned surge sealift fleet
(including large medium speed roll-on/roll-off vessels) to rapidly load equipment and supplies to deploy
where needed. These ships are responsible for conducting intertheater sea operations. Intratheater water
operations are conducted by MSC, commercial watercraft, and Army watercraft organizations. These
organizations perform the operational maneuver and sealift of sustainment and units and support marine
terminal operations and distribution operations.
1-93. MSC also employs ships from the ready reserve fleet, including fast sealift ships. These ships, which
are owned and maintained in reduced operating status by the Maritime Administration, come under MSC
control when activated. Assured access to additional sealift and intermodal capacity is gained through a
partnership with the United States flag maritime industry, by way of the voluntary intermodal sealift
agreement and maritime security program. A balanced reliance on organic and commercial assets—product
tankers, dry-cargo ships, vessels with unique capabilities, and access to their associated ports and intermodal
networks—optimizes sealift response in support of the warfighter. Some ready reserve fleet vessels have
unique features to support JLOTS where fixed ports may be inadequate, damaged, or nonexistent.

Air Mobility Command
1-94. AMC is the Air Force Service component that provides the capability to deploy Army forces
worldwide and to help sustain them across a range of military operations. AMC operationally directs the use
of domestic and international airlift services, including the civil reserve air fleet. AMC has the capability to
rapidly employ aerial ports around the world. AMC performs airlift, air refueling, aeromedical evacuation,
air mobility support, and supports the strategic flow of deploying forces’ equipment and supplies from the
aerial port of embarkation to the theater and return.

1-95. AMC and the TSC work together to provide a seamless strategic/theater interface to provide for the
efficient RSO of forces and supplies to and from the theater. Air terminal support operations include port
clearance, operation of holding and marshalling areas, postal operations, personnel processing, movement
control, onward movement, security, and life support. The TSC may perform some of these functions at
locations other than the joint aerial complex.

1-96. The role of AMC is to serve as the single port manager for air mobility. AMC’s fleet of air mobility
aircraft is joined by commercial air carriers to deliver cargo and personnel anywhere in the world in a matter
of hours. During contingencies and operations, AMC assets support both intertheater and intratheater
common-user airlift operations. Although primarily used for intertheater operations, AMC assets can be
assigned to support theater operations and may be temporarily assigned to CCMD control. AMC uses Service
cargo transfer units to expedite cargo through the aerial port of debarkation (APOD) and into the theater
distribution network. For additional information see ATP 3-35.

1-97. Key tasks associated with AMC include—
􀁺 Managing common-use aerial ports of embarkation or APODs.
􀁺 Supervising cargo documentation.
􀁺 Cargo loading and unloading.
􀁺 Providing clearance.
􀁺 Movement operations.
􀁺 Security.
