UNITED STATES ARMY MATERIEL COMMAND
1-120. USAMC provides technology, acquisition support, materiel development, logistics power
projection, and sustainment to the total force. USAMC manages the global supply chain by synchronizing
logistics and sustainment activities across the Army while also providing support to joint and multinational
partners across commodities. It assists the CCDR in shaping the OE to support the CCDR’s overall objectives
to include sustainment maintenance support. USAMC handles most of the Army’s contracting services for
deployed units in coordination with the theater Army, TSC G-4, G-8, and TSC DMC. It executes contracting
support through its subordinate contracting support brigade (CSB), Army field support brigade (AFSB), and
LOGCAP. USAMC also provides installation-level services, supplies, and common-use information
technology hardware and software. USAMC also maintains APS, both on land and afloat.

Army Sustainment Command
1-121. Army Sustainment Command (ASC) integrates and synchronizes the delivery of USAMC and
materiel enterprise capabilities at echelon from the strategic to the tactical level. It delivers materiel readiness,
force generation, power projection, and sets the conditions for future readiness at home station. ASC forward
stationed capabilities provide C2 to all USAMC assets in theater and shape the logistics environment and
help set the theater to accelerate force reception into theater. Deployable logistics support elements provide
corps and divisions the ability to rapidly integrate the delivery of USAMC capabilities into the theater at
echelon for responsive support to warfighter priorities. It serves as the Army’s lead materiel integrator,
identifying excess and obsolete major end items and providing disposition instructions to units. It is
responsible for integrating logistics support with strategic partners and links the national sustainment base
with the expeditionary Army. Major mission areas include logistics synchronization in support of the Army
Regionally Aligned Readiness and Modernization Model, APS, materiel management, and LOGCAP.
Mission execution is through a global network of organizations to include the ASC staff, AFSBs, Army field
support battalions, logistics readiness centers, and logistics support elements embedded in units from brigade
to corps. See FM 4-0 for additional information on ASC and ATP 4-98 for the AFSB, its subordinate units,
and operations.

U.S. Army Security Assistance Command
1-122. U.S. Army Security Assistance Command leads the USAMC Security Assistance Enterprise. It
enables security cooperation, military engagement, and other activities conducted to build partner capacity
and support and strengthen U.S. global partnerships. The command acts as the primary entry point for Army
materiel, service-related, and non-institutional foreign military sales and security assistance requirements as
requested by partner nations to enable CCMD strategic priorities.

USAMC Life Cycle Management Commands
1-123. USAMC provides logistics, technology, acquisition support, and selected logistics support to Army
forces as well as USAMC-related common support to other Services and multinational and interagency
partners. This is accomplished principally through national-level maintenance and supply programs managed
and executed by the life cycle management commands (LCMC) that are OPCON to AFSBs when deployed.
LCMCs are the USAMC organizations with responsibility to mobilize and deploy sustainment-level
maintenance forward repair activities from CONUS LCMC depots and arsenals. LCMCs conduct theaterlevel
contingency planning with USAMC, ASC, and TSCs during deliberate planning to set the theater. These
USAMC LCMCs include USAMC staff as well as related Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition,
Logistics, and Technology program executive office and program management offices. Together, these
elements work to ensure support for fielded weapon systems and equipment for their entire life cycle.
Program executive office and program management staffs often work in the same office or on the ground in
the field along with USAMC LCMC item managers and other technical support personnel. The following
paragraphs discuss the USAMC LCMCs.
